# Challenge 2

Given a mock credit card transaction history (**input.csv**):
1. How much payment did I make in this month? Watch out that not all transactions are debts. There are some transactions where I'm paying back my credit card. The debt transactions will start with a negative sign.
2. Find the merchant name where I made the most number of transactions? (e.g. 10 transactions at Lobster Palace alone)
3. Find the category where I spent the most money (e.g. Food & Drinks)
4. Out of the 30 days in April, how many days did I not spent money?
5. What % of transactions (both + and -) are under $50?
